# Hi there, I'm Edd Palencia-Vanegas 👋
Software Engineer | Machine Learning Specialist | Automation Expert

I am a Software Engineer with a Master’s in Information Technology (Computer Science). My work bridges the gap between complex data analysis and practical software solutions, with a particular focus on building intelligent systems and automating high-impact industrial workflows.

## 🚀 What I Do

Machine Learning: Developing and optimizing models using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, from multi-class classification to deep learning pipelines for signal processing.
Process Automation: Transforming manual workflows into efficient digital processes—I recently engineered Python-based tools that improved data processing efficiency by up to 90%.
Full-Stack Development & Design: Leveraging a diverse toolkit including Python, C++, C#, and JavaScript to build robust applications and research simulations.
